# The Game: Escape from RCB
In this game, you play as a student at SFU who, amid the chaos of finals season, accidentally slips 
into a deep slumber. Exhausted from constant studying, looming assignment deadlines, and the stress 
of cramming missed lectures, the student awakens to find themselves lost in the dark maze known as 
Robert C. Brown Hall (iykyk). 

As the player, you must evade various threats, including a rabid bear, a zombie professor, and the 
looming specter of a failed exam. With the help of copious amounts of caffeine, ever-moving A+ papers, 
and the occasional cozy bed, you just might find a way out of this labyrinth. However, beware of the 
many piles of books, vortexes that can respawn your location, and the disorienting hidden smoke 
that could hinder your escape.

# Game Objective:
Collect all reward items (A+ papers, coffees, beds) and successfully exit the level. The game ends 
if the player is caught by an enemy or if their score falls below zero.

# To Run the Game:
1. Download the LostInRCB.jar file.
2. Ensure that Java is installed on your system.
3. Open the command line and navigate to the location of the LostInRCB.jar file.
```

```
